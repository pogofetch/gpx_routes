# pogo-gpx-archive
Collection of GPX route files for Pokemon Go

>   Each route is available as .gpx or .txt file as you prefer, depending on what is easiest for your client to parse & load

>   Files under the 'Hotspot Routes' directory are paths plotted around locales with very high density placements of Pokestops & Gyms, intended to be walked in laps (usually while auto-catching & spinning with Gotcha or GoPlus for farming dust, candy grinding XP etc)
      
>   Files under the 'Pokestop Marathons' directory are long paths through major cities around the world designed to hit as many unique pokestops as possible sequentially in that area 

>   These are particularly effective to walk during events rewarding bonus XP/dust for spinning stops the player has not visited before

>   Each marathon path is available as a single file, or as several smaller sub-routes (trying to load a massive path can crash some clients or devices)

Also included in this repo:
>   List of coords for teleporting to a number of popular locations & hotspots for raiding & community days

>   List of 'hunting grounds' known to spawn regional Pokemon for that biome
